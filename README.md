# Pet Surveillance Bot
**Project Goal:** Using *only* C#, create a publicly accessible live server to control the movement of a streaming robotic device that has pet recognition and movement detection capabilities.

## Designing
**Purpose:** Prior to implementing the deployable C# code for this project onto a device, familiarization with the libraries is required to ensure a well designed, robust software implementation. 

**Procedure:** Using `.NET Interactive`, `Emgu.CV`, and `ASP.NET`, I will get comfortable with the various modules that will be used in the final implementation of this project. The designing workflow will be:
1. Face and Eye Detection Using Images - [Design/FacialImageDetections.ipynb](Design/FacialImageDetections.ipynb)
2. Face and Eye Detection in Real-Time - [Design/FacialRealTimeDetections.ipynb](Design/FacialRealTimeDetections.ipynb)
3. Port Forward a Live Server -
4. Stream Real-Time Camera on Live Server

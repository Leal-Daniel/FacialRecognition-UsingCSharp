# Pet Surveillance Bot
**Project Goal:** Using C#, create a publicly accessible live server to control the movement of a streaming robotic device that has pet recognition and movement detection capabilities.

## Designing
Prior to implementing the deployable C# code for this project onto a device, familiarization with the libraries is required to ensure a well designed software. 

Using `.NET Interactive`, I will get comfortable with the various modules that will be used in the final implementation of this project. The designing workflow in this notebook file will be:
1. [Face and Eye Detection Using Images](FacialRecognition.ipynb)
   - Purpose: Become familiarized with `OpenCV` and `Emgu.CV` capabilities in .NET.
   ![FacialDetection-Usingimages](Images/FacialDetection-UsingImages.JPG)

2. Face and Eye Detection in Real-Time
   - Purpose: Connect `Emgu.CV` to a real-time camera device.

3. Deploy a Basic Live Server and Port Forward
   - Purpose: Become familiarized with `ASP.NET Core` web capabilities.

4. Stream Real-Time Camera on Live Server
   - Purpose: Become familiarized using `ASP.NET Core`'s interface with `OpenCV` streaming.
